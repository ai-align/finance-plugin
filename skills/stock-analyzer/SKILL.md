# Stock Analyzer

A specialized skill designed to provide in-depth financial stock analysis, utilizing market data to evaluate investment opportunities and trends.

## Capabilities
- **Technical Analysis**: Interpret technical indicators such as Moving Averages, RSI, and MACD to identify trends and potential entry/exit points.
- **Fundamental Analysis**: Evaluate company financial health through balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow analysis.
- **Market Trends**: Analyze broader market trends and sector performance to contextualize individual stock movements.
- **Peer Comparison**: Compare stocks against industry peers to assess relative valuation and performance.

## Context and examples
Use this skill when the user asks for:
- "Analyze the recent performance of AAPL"
- "Is TSLA a good buy right now based on technicals?"
- "Compare the financials of Coke vs Pepsi"
- "What are the current trends in the semiconductor sector?"

This skill is best used for quantitative and qualitative financial assessments rather than executing trades.
